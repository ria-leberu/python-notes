# Heaps are a tree data structure that satisfy the heap property:
# Min Heaps are when the parent node is less than or equal to a child, the minimum value at the root
# Max Heaps are when the parent is greater than or equal to a child, the maximum value at the root
# Binary heaps are the most common
# A priority queue is an abstract data type, and a heap is the implementation of it

# Heaps are used for finding the smallest or largest item in a dataset quickly
# When you see problems like "Kth" in the title, consider heaps

# Important areas where heaps are used:
# Heap sort, Graph algorithms (to find the shortest path, like Djikstras or Prim's MST), Selection algorithms (find median in data stream, find kth element in a list), K-way merge (merging data sets)
